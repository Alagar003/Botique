                    At Lotus, we specialize in designer sarees, custom-made blouses and other costumes, and any sort of ceremonial ensemble for
                    women and kids and Men. At a glance, it is a boutique store with a great collection of designer attire. The difference is that most of the clothes we make are inspired by our nation's rich heritage of art and craft. We blend these heritage-inspired designs with the finest fabrics (such as Banaras silk and Kanchipuram silk) and shape them according to the customer's needs. Thanks to our exceptional team of designers, embroidery/cutwork specialists and other supporting staff, the Lotus creations have already
                    succeeded in setting a noble trend in the ceremonial.
